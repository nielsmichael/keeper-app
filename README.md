# Keeper App Challenge

This is a note keeping app built using React as a part of my web developmennt course.

The inital repo got screwed up so I ended up deleting it and redoing it. Kind of a bummer but at least it was good learning and practice using git.

## To Do

1) Implement a backend with NodeJS to store notes so that they do not reset upon reload

2) Experiment with moving the stored notes into a MongoDB database to make a complete MERN web application
